### Idea 1: 3D "Simon" Says Game

This project is a game that is similar to "Simon Says".  The game works by displaying a seqeunce of 
lights and tones that correlate to a specific button on the device.  The game player than attempts to 
input the same sequence as the device displayed.  The sequence starts at a length of 1 and increases by 1 
with each successful matched sequence input by the player.  When the player inputs an incorrect sequence 
the game ends and reports the length of the final correct sequence. This project will build on this 
concept by changing the typical plane of 4 buttons and expand it to a 3D shape such as a cube with 6 
buttons or a octahedron with 8 sides.  The device will use tactile buttons as sensors. The device will 
actuate a speaker and LEDs.  This project can be implemented using an ATMega328P microcontroller.

Sensor: Onen button for every side of the object

Actuator: One LED for every button and a speaker for audible tones

Controller: ATMega328P

### Idea 2: Sprinkler Controller

### Idea 3: Digital Lockbox
